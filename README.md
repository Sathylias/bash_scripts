# SCRIPTS 

## XSETCMUS
Prints out the song's title and the duration, displayed on dwm's statusbar
If you don't know what dwm is, head over to https://dwm.suckless.org

## Convert seconds to minutes
Needed that script to get the duration in minutes from cmus

## docker_destroy
Since I'm currently doing extensive learning on Docker, I accumulate containers
and sometimes I just want a quick and easy way to remove all the containers and
start all over. This script does just that !
